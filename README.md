# Python-PiNFC

I decided to try my hand at making a small NFC Authentication system using Python and my Raspberry Pi.

Currently utilizing: 

Blank NFC Cards
NFC Token
Raspberry Pi 3 + Waveshare PN532 NFC HAT

## The Idea

By using unique NFC cards (Potentially with unique keys for encrpytion?), tapping them on the NFC reciever should create a record of the event on a seperate server. Currently planning to use Wi-Fi and UDP, though I would like the core of the project to be used across any form of communication.
